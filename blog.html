										<h1>4 tips for designing for visually impaired users</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/eye.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<p>In the United States alone, 53.2 million people above the age of 45 identify themselves as visually impaired with conditions that range in severity, 18% of those individuals are legally blind. Though many think that the term visual impairment means blindness only, it actually encompasses a far greater scope of conditions and disabilities— the most common being low vision and color blindness. People affected by color blindness have difficulty distinguishing colors, for example not being able to identify red from green or yellow from blue, in the most severe cases color blind individuals are unable to perceive color at all. On a global scale, 8% of men identify as color blind along with 0.5% of women. People with low vision even while assisted with glasses, contact lenses, and medication may struggle to perform everyday tasks such as reading the mail and signing paperwork. The most common types of low vision are night blindness (being unable to see in low light), central vision loss (being unable to see things in the center of your vision), and peripheral vision loss (being unable to see things on the outside corners of your vision).</p>
									<p>Although the visually impaired population is tiny compared to the overall global population, accessibility demands that their needs be considered by web designers. Below are four tips for designing inclusively for visually impaired users.</p>
									

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Do give users keyboard accessibility</h2>
									<p>To be considered fully accessible, a web page must be navigable by someone using only a keyboard. Granting users keyboard accessibility, and the use of keyboard shortcuts, makes navigating web pages easier, especially for users who are unable to use a mouse and may struggle with hand-eye coordination. Keyboard commands allow users with low vision to navigate web pages without the added stress of having to track a cursor.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Do use descriptive link labels</h2>
									<p>Using explicit link labels is a best practice that not only benefits users with impaired vision. Link labels like “click here” with no surrounding context should be avoided as they hinder individuals attempting to navigate web pages using a screen reader. It is important for designers to create link labels that tell the user what or where they are navigating to without relying on surrounding content.</p>

									<h2>Don’t rely on color use alone </h2>
									<p>When the element of color is taken away from a web page, the user should still be able to navigate it without issue. Only using color to communicate important information creates a barrier for visually impaired users, colorblind individuals may not be able to interpret colored indicators, and screen readers do not have a function for processing and announcing colors to blind individuals. When working with and creating content, designers should consider what additional differentiation could be added to elements alongside color— for example, the use of the color blue could be used to distinguish text as a link, but this text could also be bolded, underlined, or accompanied by a symbol.</p>

									<h2>Do utilize contrast </h2>
									<p>While designing, consider the level of contrast between color shades. Users with visual impairment may rely on high contrast to distinguish text and other elements from the background of a webpage. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (the standard of web accessibility compliance in the United States) says that when it comes to contrast is that text, and images containing text, must have a contrast ratio of 4:5:1. </p>
									<p>The following web tools can be used when designing to test for adequate contrast:</p>
